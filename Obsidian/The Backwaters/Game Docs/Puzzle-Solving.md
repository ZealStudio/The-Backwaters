Level 1

Hidden in plain sight: Hide an object or item that the players need to find in plain sight, but disguise it as something else. For example, a key could be hidden inside a book, or a valuable item could be disguised as a common household object.

Cryptic Clues: Leave cryptic clues around the area that the players must decipher in order to find the next clue or solution to their problem. These clues could take the form of riddles, puzzles, or seemingly unrelated objects that hold a hidden message or significance.

Memory Game: Set up a series of clues and challenges that the players must complete by using their memories. This could involve remembering details from a previous challenge, recalling information from a previous encounter, or using their memory to solve a puzzle or riddle.

Proposed ideas - Miguel lawl
The first puzzle should be a chase sequence where you have to pull the levers in order for the door at the end to be unlocked otherwise it's game over... But don't pull the one that says "DO NOT PULL" otherwise it might not actually open... Lol. 

The second puzzle would be in the library area(?) where there are books to read but you have to find the year published between all of them, but there is a highlighted number to find but the passages may be different 
-one book would be a math problem book for the lols so like it starts with jake ordered 12 watermelons but split them between 3 of his friends so they had an equal amount each, and then jake ate 2, but his friends didn't. How many watermelons does every one else have? This would be dated 18xx
-One book will just have the number 2 written all over with no known date, it's scratched off or but the first year is 2xxx.
-The other book would have a book documenting the tragedy of a pop idol group that would end up mysteriously dying, but mysteriously while mentioning 5 of them only 4 of them are gone... The book would be in 19xx.
-The other book is a self help book with 5 tips to a happier life with the number 4 being scratched up. The readable date is 17xxx.
The answer would be 4342
THEN THE CHASE SEQUENCE WOA
